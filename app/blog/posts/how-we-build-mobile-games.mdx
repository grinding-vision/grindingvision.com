At Grinding Vision, every project starts with one question: **will this feel great on a phone in under 30 seconds?**

We build our games in fast iterations and validate ideas early. A typical project moves through these stages:

## 1) Concept and Pillars

We define 2-3 gameplay pillars first. These pillars guide every decision, from controls to monetization.

## 2) Rapid Prototyping

Before polished art, we create playable prototypes and test core loops with internal sessions.

## 3) Vertical Slice

Once the loop is fun, we build a representative slice with final-quality visuals, UI, and progression.

## 4) Soft Launch

We release to a limited audience, gather retention and economy data, and improve onboarding.

## 5) Global Release and Live Ops

After key metrics stabilize, we scale globally and support the game with events, content drops, and tuning.

Our goal is simple: create mobile games that are easy to start, rewarding to master, and exciting to return to every day.
